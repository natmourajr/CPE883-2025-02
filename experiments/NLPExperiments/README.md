# NLP Experiments
This will contain the experiments for all of the developed NLP models. Running Group KAN requires a GPU because of its dependency on rational_kat_cu. Currently just the Dockerfile exists here and the training code is with the model code (need to migrate here since I reused another repo heavily)

## Current NLP Options
* BERT
* KANBERT
* GPT
* KANGPT

## Loader
These experiments use the NLPLoader dataloader.
